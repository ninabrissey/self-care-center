## About The Project
This is a project I built during Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design. This project was used to introduce students to HTML and CSS by matching a comp provided. We were also asked to implement Javascript functionality that we have been learned up to this point by utilizing event listeners to and respond to user events. This was an opportunity to work independently and individualize our skill set.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html).

## About The Webpage
How can you care for myself spiritually? One way is with affirmations and mantras! Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated during mindfulness practices. This website will reveal several different mantras or affirmations depending on what you are in the mood for!
